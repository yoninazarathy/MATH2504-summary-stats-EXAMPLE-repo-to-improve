# MATH2504-summary-stats-EXAMPLE-repo-to-improve

This is an example repo with Julia code that is to improved as part of a [MATH2504](https://courses.smp.uq.edu.au/MATH2504/2022/) practical. It is meant to be used with [Practical E](https://github.com/yoninazarathy/ProgrammingCourse-with-Julia-SimulationAnalysisAndLearningSystems/blob/main/practicals_jupyter/practical_E_towards_project_submission.ipynb). The instructions on the practical sheet suggest how to modify this repository, in a way that is roughly analogous to [Project 1](https://courses.smp.uq.edu.au/MATH2504/2022/assessment_html/project1.html).
 
To load all functionality run:

```
julia> include("summary_stats_project.jl")
```

You may then use functionality such as,

```
julia> 
```

To execute all unit tests run:

```
julia> include("test/runtests.jl")
```

You may see examples in `example_script.jl` and run that script line by line.
